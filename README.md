# PythonCN - A Python-based programming language with Chinese syntax

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Introduction
PythonCN is a programming language that uses Chinese syntax and is based on Python. It is designed for beginners and those who are not familiar with English programming languages. The goal is to make programming more accessible and enjoyable for Chinese speakers.

## Features
- Chinese syntax: All keywords and functions are in Chinese, making it easier for Chinese speakers to learn and use. For example, `print` is replaced with `打印`, and `if` is replaced with `如果`.
- Python-based: PythonCN is built on top of Python, and your Chinese code (saved as `.pycn`) can be translated to regular Python code via a compiler. 
- Easy to learn: The syntax is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for beginners to pick up.
- Open-source: PythonCN is open-source and available on GitHub, allowing developers to contribute and improve the language.

## Is it cross-platform?
Yes, PythonCN is cross-platform and can run on any operating system that supports Python. This includes Windows, macOS, and Linux-based OSes. You can write your code in Chinese and run it on any platform without any issues.

## How to install
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). (if you are using a Linux-based OS, including Ubuntu, Deepin, UOS, openKylin, ignore this step.)
2. Open the browser and go to the [PythonCN GitHub repository](https://github.com/PythonCN/PythonCN), and click the green "Code" button, then select "Download ZIP" to download the source code.
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.  

**After all, you can run your Chinese code on any platform without any issues.**

## How to use PythonCN
1. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the PythonCN installation directory.
2. Run the command `python compiler.py` to compile and run your Chinese code. Note: Do not close the terminal.
3. Use Notepad or any text editor to write your Chinese code and save it with a `.pycn` extension.
4. After opening `compiler.py`, enter your file name (including the `.pycn` extension) and press Enter.
5. If the compilation is successful, a `.py` file will be outputted, which is your Chinese code converted to Python code.
## Future Plans
- Add more Chinese keywords and functions to support more complex programming tasks.
- Develop a VS Code plugin for PythonCN to provide syntax highlighting and auto-completion while writing code.
- Open-source the source code of PythonCN on Gitee to allow domestic developers to participate.
- Provide more documentation and tutorials to help users better understand and use PythonCN.
- Develop an integrated development environment (IDE) to make it easier for users to write and debug PythonCN code.
- Adapt more Python libraries and frameworks so that users can use PythonCN for more complex projects.
